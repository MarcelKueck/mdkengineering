# MDK Engineering — Venture Orientation Guide

## Who You Are

You are a full-stack AI engineer, inventor, and technical generalist based in Munich. You combine deep software and AI expertise with hands-on hardware capability — a rare profile that most consultants and freelancers cannot match.

**Background:**
- Computer Science degree from TU Munich
- Research experience at University of Oxford
- Software/Robotics Engineer at Siemens and Devanthro (the Robody Company)
- Founded 2 startups
- Hardware skills: 3D printing, PCB design, circuit board design
- Software skills: AI/ML, automation, full-stack development, robotics

## Your Differentiator

The AI consulting market is flooded with people who learned prompt engineering or no-code tools six months ago. You are not one of them. Your edge is **depth combined with breadth** — you can design a circuit board, train a model, write production code, and ship a working prototype. End to end, concept to reality.

**Core differentiator statement:**
> "I don't just advise on AI — I engineer complete solutions, from prototype to production, across software and hardware."

**What you are NOT:**
- A generic "AI consultant" competing on Upwork at $30/hr
- A prompt engineer selling ChatGPT wrappers
- A no-code automation guy who learned Make last month
- A big consultancy charging €2,000/day for PowerPoint decks

**What you ARE:**
- An inventor who builds working technology
- An engineer who can go from idea to prototype in weeks
- A bridge between the physical and digital world
- Someone with the academic credibility (TUM + Oxford) and industry experience (Siemens) to be trusted with serious projects

## Positioning Strategy

### The Inventor Brand

Don't suppress the inventor identity — it IS the brand. Most consultants position themselves as advisors. You position yourself as a builder. This is more compelling and more differentiated. Clients don't just get advice — they get working technology.

### Niche Selection (Pick 1–2 to Lead With)

**Option A: Industrial Automation + AI (Strongest Fit)**
- Your Siemens background gives instant credibility
- German Mittelstand companies are desperate for this but don't trust pure software people
- You understand both the factory floor and the AI layer
- Low competition from other freelancers (most AI freelancers have zero industrial experience)
- High willingness to pay — these companies have real budgets

**Option B: Hardware-Software Integration with AI**
- Almost nobody can design a PCB, write firmware, AND build an ML pipeline
- Companies building smart products, IoT devices, or robotic systems need exactly this
- Your Devanthro robotics experience makes this credible
- Growing market as more physical products get "smart" features

**Option C: Rapid Prototyping / Proof of Concept Builds**
- Startups and corporate innovation teams need someone to turn vague ideas into working demos in 2–6 weeks
- Your startup founder experience + technical range makes this natural
- Great entry point for relationships that turn into larger engagements
- Showcases your full-stack capability

**Recommended approach:** Lead with Industrial AI + Automation (Option A) for positioning and marketing, but accept projects across all three areas. As you build a client base, the market will tell you where the strongest demand is.

## Pricing Strategy

### Don't Undercharge

Given your background (TUM, Oxford, Siemens, 2x founder), charging less than €100/hr signals "junior freelancer" rather than "expert engineer." German companies especially associate price with quality.

### Rate Guidelines

| Engagement Type | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Hourly consulting | €120–€150/hr | For advisory, architecture reviews, workshops |
| Project-based work | €5,000–€50,000+ | Preferred — price by value, not hours |
| Weekly retainer | €2,500–€5,000/week | For ongoing embedded consulting |
| Discovery call | Free (30 min) | Lead qualification — always offer this |

### Pricing Principles

- **Price by project/value whenever possible.** If automating a process saves a client €100k/year, charging €15k for the project is easy to justify regardless of hours spent.
- **Always start with a paid discovery/assessment phase.** Offer a €2,000–€5,000 "AI Readiness Assessment" or "Automation Audit" as the first paid engagement. This is low-risk for the client and often leads to larger projects.
- **Never discount without removing scope.** If a client can't afford the full price, reduce what you deliver — don't reduce your rate.

## Client Acquisition — Ranked by Effectiveness

### 1. Your Existing Network (Start Immediately)

This is your highest-conversion channel. Half of all consulting work comes through warm introductions.

**Action plan:**
- Make a list of every former colleague at Siemens, Devanthro, your startups, TUM, and Oxford
- Send 20+ personal messages this week
- Don't pitch — simply inform: "I've gone independent, specializing in AI automation and prototyping. If you ever hear of someone who needs help, I'd appreciate you thinking of me."
- Follow up with everyone who responds positively
- Your Siemens network alone could sustain your first year

### 2. LinkedIn (Highest-Leverage Free Channel)

LinkedIn is where your target clients (German engineering managers, CTOs, innovation leads) spend time. It's your primary content and visibility platform.

**Posting strategy:**
- Post 2–3 times per week
- Show your work: real builds, prototypes, code, hardware, project updates
- Share opinions on tools and technology (these get engagement)
- Write mini case studies of problems you've solved
- Behind-the-scenes of your inventor process
- Avoid generic "AI will change the world" content — be specific and technical

**Profile optimization:**
- Headline: *"AI Engineer & Automation Specialist | TUM + Oxford | Helping companies build intelligent systems"*
- Banner image: your workspace, a prototype, or something that signals "I build things"
- About section: your story in first person, ending with a clear CTA
- Featured section: link to your website, key blog posts, showcase projects

### 3. German Mittelstand Direct Outreach

Hundreds of mid-sized German manufacturers and engineering firms know they need AI but don't know where to start. You speak their language — literally and culturally.

**Tactics:**
- Attend industry events: Hannover Messe, local IHK events, Munich tech meetups, Automatica
- Offer a free "AI Readiness Assessment" as a door opener (30-min call to identify automation opportunities)
- Join relevant industry associations and communities
- Partner with Industrie 4.0 initiatives and networks
- Write content specifically addressing Mittelstand pain points

### 4. Showcase Projects (Build Your Portfolio)

If you don't have paying client work yet, create impressive projects that demonstrate your capability and publish them openly.

**Project ideas:**
- AI-powered quality inspection system with a €200 camera and Raspberry Pi
- An end-to-end automation pipeline (e.g., "I automated my own invoicing with AI")
- A smart IoT device with custom PCB, 3D-printed enclosure, and edge AI
- An open-source tool that solves a real problem in your niche

**Document everything:** GitHub repo + blog post + LinkedIn post + video demo. One project becomes four pieces of content.

### 5. Subcontracting & Agency Partnerships

Connect with consultancies and agencies that sell AI projects but need technical talent to deliver.

**Targets in Munich/Germany:**
- Reply, MHP, smaller digital agencies
- Innovation consultancies that lack in-house engineering
- Other freelancers who need a technical partner
- Startup studios that need prototype builders

This gives you steady income while you build your direct client base.

### 6. Content & SEO (Medium-Term)

Blog posts on your website that target search queries your ideal clients are typing.

**High-value article topics:**
- "AI process automation for manufacturing: a practical guide"
- "How to evaluate if your business process is ready for AI"
- "Building an AI prototype: what it costs and what to expect"
- "n8n vs Make vs Zapier for AI automation in 2026"
- "Why your AI project failed (and how to fix it)"

Publish 2–4 articles per month. Each should end with a soft CTA linking to your contact page.

### 7. Platforms (Use Selectively)

- **Toptal**: Apply and get vetted. Best platform for your profile — clients expect to pay real rates and the vetting filters out noise.
- **Avoid the Upwork/Fiverr race to the bottom.** Your profile doesn't belong there.
- **LinkedIn Services Marketplace**: Free, easy to set up, surfaces you to local clients.

---

## What to Avoid

- **Don't spread thin across platforms.** Focus on network + LinkedIn + website. Add channels only when those are working.
- **Don't undercharge.** €50/hr positions you as junior. €120+/hr positions you as expert. German companies respect this.
- **Don't wait until everything is perfect.** Get your first 2–3 clients through your network WHILE you build the website, refine the brand, and create content.
- **Don't compete on "AI."** Everyone says AI now. Compete on "I build the whole thing, end to end, and it works." That's what clients actually pay for.
- **Don't do free work to "build a portfolio."** Charge for everything, even if it's a reduced rate for your first projects. Free work attracts clients who will never pay.

## Mindset Notes

You have an exceptional profile. TUM + Oxford + Siemens + robotics + 2x founder + hardware skills is a combination that maybe a few hundred people in Germany have. The challenge is not whether you're good enough — it's making sure the right people know you exist.

The hardest part for technical founders going into consulting is usually sales. But sales as an independent engineer is really just: build things, show your work, talk to people, and make it easy for them to hire you. You already love building — now you just need to make the building visible.

Your "inventor who loves what he does" energy is your most powerful marketing asset. Don't try to sound corporate. Be the engineer who gets excited about solving problems. That authenticity is what people want to buy.
