# MDK Engineering — Strategic Roadmap

## Current Focus: AI Knowledge Systems

MDK Engineering's primary service offering is **production-grade RAG and AI knowledge systems** for organizations where accuracy, domain-specificity, and compliance matter. Current client domains: academic research, e-commerce, and healthcare (German medical practices).

### Why this focus now
- Active paying clients across multiple industries
- Medical practice AI copilot product in development (fully DSGVO-compliant)
- RAG/knowledge systems market is high-demand with strong 2025-2026 timing
- Cross-industry experience is a differentiator — few RAG consultants have delivered across research, retail, and healthcare
- Projects have shorter sales cycles and faster time-to-value than hardware/robotics engagements

### Near-term goals
- Ship the medical copilot to pilot stage
- Stack 3-5 strong case studies across domains
- Establish reputation as the go-to knowledge systems specialist for organizations that need production-grade, not prototype-grade

## Future Direction: Robotics & Robot Learning

Marcel's background in robotics (Devanthro, humanoid robots) and passion for reinforcement learning / imitation learning is a long-term strategic asset. The plan is to **sequence, not choose** — build robotics credibility in parallel, then launch it as a second service line once the knowledge systems business is stable.

### Phase 1 — Now to ~18 months: Knowledge Systems is the business
- All client work, website positioning, and content focused on RAG / document AI / consulting
- Revenue stability and case study accumulation are the priority

### Phase 2 — Parallel, low effort: Build robotics visibility
- Write occasional blog posts / LinkedIn content about RL and imitation learning
- Attend robotics conferences and maintain network (Automatica, ICRA, CoRL)
- Contribute to open-source robotics / RL projects
- Build a documented side project demonstrating imitation learning on a real robot arm
- None of this requires paying clients — it's credibility-building

### Phase 3 — When ready: Add robotics as a service line
- Once knowledge systems revenue is consistent and predictable
- Take on a first robotics engagement (potentially at reduced margin) to create the initial case study
- Reposition website to encompass both offerings under a unified narrative

### The connecting thread
Both service lines share a coherent higher-level story: **building AI systems that learn from existing knowledge and apply it in practice** — whether that knowledge lives in documents (RAG) or in human demonstrations (imitation learning). This unified positioning only works once there's credibility in both areas.

| Date     | Decision                                                        | Rationale                                                                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feb 2025 | Pivot from general AI consultancy to AI Knowledge Systems focus | Active clients, market timing, shorter sales cycles                                                     |
| Feb 2025 | Defer robotics/RL as primary offering                           | No current clients in that space, no deployed case studies as consultant, long sales cycles             |
| Feb 2025 | Keep robotics as Phase 2 parallel track                         | Passion area with real background (Devanthro), builds toward future service line without financial risk |
