# MDK Engineering — Complete Website Plan

## Brand Identity

### Core Positioning
**"Engineering intelligence into reality."**

MDK Engineering is not another AI consultancy. It's an engineering studio run by an inventor — someone who bridges the gap between intelligent software and physical systems, from concept to working prototype to production. The brand should feel like walking into a high-end workshop where precision meets creativity.

### Brand Personality
- **Inventive** — not corporate, not startup-bro, but genuinely curious and creative
- **Technical depth** — the kind of person who can explain a transformer architecture AND solder a circuit board
- **German engineering meets academic rigor** — TUM precision + Oxford research credibility
- **Approachable expertise** — serious work, human delivery

### Visual Identity Direction
- **Aesthetic**: Industrial-refined. Think: dark workshop meets clean engineering drawings. Not the typical blue-gradient AI consultant look.
- **Color palette**: Dark charcoal/near-black base (#1a1a1a), warm white text (#f5f0eb), an accent color like engineering orange (#e8641b) or electric blue (#2d7ff9) — something that pops against the dark like a status LED on a machine.
- **Typography**: A distinctive monospace or engineering-style display font (e.g., JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, or Space Mono) for headings. A clean sans-serif for body (e.g., DM Sans, Satoshi). This signals "I write code AND build things."
- **Visual motifs**: Blueprint-style lines, subtle grid patterns, photographs of real hardware and prototypes (not stock AI imagery), code snippets, CAD renders.

## Page-by-Page Breakdown

### 1. HOME — Landing Page

This is where 80% of visitors will decide whether to stay or leave. It must communicate *who you are*, *what you do*, and *why you're different* within 5 seconds.

**Hero Section**
- Bold headline: Something like *"I engineer AI into real systems."* or *"From concept to working prototype. AI, automation, and the engineering in between."*
- 1–2 sentence subline: *"I'm an AI engineer and inventor based in Munich. I help companies automate processes, build intelligent systems, and turn ideas into working technology — end to end."*
- Primary CTA button: "Let's Talk" → scrolls to contact or opens booking link
- Secondary CTA: "See My Work" → scrolls to projects
- Background: subtle animated grid/blueprint pattern, or a tasteful hero image of your workspace/prototype

**What I Do — Services Overview (3–4 cards)**
Short, visual summary. Each links to the full Services page.

| Service | One-Liner |
|---|---|
| AI & Automation | Intelligent systems that eliminate manual work |
| Rapid Prototyping | From idea to working demo in weeks |
| Hardware-Software Integration | Bridging the physical and digital |
| Technical Consulting | Architecture, strategy, and hands-on guidance |

**Trust & Credibility Bar**
A single horizontal strip showing:
- TUM logo | Oxford logo | Siemens logo | Devanthro logo
- Text: "Background in computer science, robotics, and AI research"
- This is NOT bragging — it's shorthand for "you can trust me with serious work"

**Featured Projects (2–3)**
Visual cards with a thumbnail, project title, and 1-line result. Link to full case studies.

**Short Testimonial / Social Proof**
Even one quote from a former colleague, manager, or startup co-founder goes a long way. If you don't have client testimonials yet, use a professional endorsement or a LinkedIn recommendation.

**CTA Section**
"Have a process that needs automating or an idea that needs building? Let's talk."
→ Contact form or Calendly link

### 3. ABOUT

This page is where people decide if they *like* you, not just whether you're qualified. It should feel personal and genuine.

**Your Story**
Write this in first person. Not a corporate bio. Something like:
> "I've always been the person who takes things apart to understand how they work — and then builds something better. I studied Computer Science at TUM, researched at Oxford, built robots at Devanthro, and engineered systems at Siemens. I've founded two startups. Now I help companies turn AI from a buzzword into working technology.
>
> I call myself an inventor because that's what I do: I invent solutions. Whether that means writing a machine learning pipeline, designing a circuit board, or 3D-printing a prototype at 2am — I do whatever it takes to make the thing work."

**Key Facts (visual, scannable)**
- 🎓 CS at TU Munich, Research at University of Oxford
- 🏭 Former Engineer at Siemens and Devanthro
- 🚀 Founded 2 startups
- 🔧 Full-stack: Software, AI, Hardware, Robotics
- 📍 Based in Munich, working globally

**Photo**
A professional but authentic photo. Ideally at a workbench, near a 3D printer, or in a workshop setting — NOT a corporate headshot against a white wall. This reinforces the inventor identity.

**Values / How I Work**
3–4 short principles, e.g.:
- *"Build the simplest thing that works, then make it better."*
- *"Technology should solve real problems, not create new ones."*
- *"I ship fast, communicate clearly, and own the outcome."*

### 4. PROJECTS / CASE STUDIES

This is the most important page for converting visitors into clients. Even if you don't have paying client projects yet, showcase personal projects, startup work, or university research.

**Structure for each case study:**
1. **Title & Visual** — project name + hero image/video
2. **The Problem** — what was the challenge? (2–3 sentences)
3. **The Approach** — what did you build and how? (3–5 sentences, mention specific technologies)
4. **The Result** — measurable outcome if possible (time saved, cost reduced, accuracy achieved)
5. **Tech Stack** — visual badges/tags (Python, TensorFlow, Arduino, custom PCB, etc.)

**Starter project ideas to showcase (build these if you haven't already):**
- An AI-powered automation you built (even for yourself — e.g., "I automated my invoice processing with an AI pipeline")
- A hardware prototype with AI (e.g., a smart sensor, a computer vision quality checker)
- An open-source tool or library you've created
- Work from your startups (anonymized if needed)
- A side project that shows range (e.g., a custom 3D-printed device with embedded AI)

Aim for 3–5 case studies at launch. Quality over quantity.

### 5. BLOG / INSIGHTS

A blog serves two purposes: SEO (people find you through Google) and credibility (people see you think deeply about your field). Publish 2–4x per month.

**Content pillars:**
1. **Technical tutorials** — "How I built X with Y" (these get shared and bookmarked)
2. **Industry perspectives** — "Why German manufacturers are behind on AI (and how to fix it)"
3. **Behind the scenes** — "Building a prototype in a weekend: what went right and wrong"
4. **Tool reviews & comparisons** — "n8n vs Make vs Zapier for AI automation in 2026"

**SEO-targeted article ideas for early content:**
- "AI process automation for manufacturing: a practical guide"
- "How to evaluate whether your business process is ready for AI"
- "Building an AI prototype: what it really costs and takes"
- "Hardware meets AI: real-world applications beyond the hype"
- "Why your AI project failed (and how to fix it)"

Each blog post should end with a soft CTA: "Working on something similar? I'd love to hear about it — reach out here."

## Summary

The website should feel like meeting a skilled engineer in their workshop — impressive but not intimidating, deep but not cluttered. Every page serves a purpose: the homepage hooks, the services page explains, the projects page proves, the about page connects, the blog attracts, and the contact page converts.

Your biggest competitive advantage is authenticity. You're not a faceless agency or a Upwork freelancer padding their profile. You're a TUM + Oxford trained engineer who builds real things. Let the website reflect that — show the work, tell the story, make it easy to reach out. Everything else is noise.
